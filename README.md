# DiffusionConvectionReaction2d
Finite elements method for Diffusion Convection Reaction problems in 2d setting

This repository contains the final project for the exam "*Metodi numerici per le equazioni alle derivate parziali*" held at Politecnico di Torino in 2022/2023.
The goal is to compute the solution for Diffusion Convection Reaction problems in a polygonal 2d domain using finite elements method. 
The repository implements P1 and P2 elements.
